# WARNING: In-development. This currently installs a profile containing solarized colors, not SMYCK. I'm working on it!


smyck-mate-terminal
=======================

Create a profile in your MATE Terminal based on SMYCK http://color.smyck.org/

## Usage

Clone this repo and then run the script in the following way:

    $ bash smyck-mate.sh

Restart you terminal, enjoy a beatiful theme!

The above will create a smyck profile in MATE Terminal.
To remove these themes, run the script in the following
way:

    $ bash smyck-mate --reset

Be warned though, this will remove all  custom themes, not
just the ones installed by the script.
